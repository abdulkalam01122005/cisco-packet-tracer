Star Topology & WAN Simulation â€“ Cisco Packet Tracer

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a Star Topology network and a Wide Area Network (WAN) using Cisco Packet Tracer. It is developed as part of networking practice to understand how LAN and WAN infrastructures operate, how devices communicate, and how routing decisions are made within interconnected networks.

ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

Star Topology Setup:

Centralized switch/router connecting multiple end devices.

Easy management and fault isolation.

WAN Design:

Interconnection of multiple LANs through routers.

Simulation of real-world enterprise networking.

Cisco Packet Tracer Simulation:

IP addressing, subnetting, and routing configuration.

Packet flow analysis to verify connectivity.

Learning Outcomes:

Understanding LAN vs WAN differences.

Network device configuration (PCs, switches, routers).

Practical experience in Cisco Packet Tracer.
